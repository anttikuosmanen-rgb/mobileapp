# Resources Directory

This directory should contain the following image files:

## Required Images

1. **background.png** (800x600 pixels)
   - Background image for the application
   - If not provided, a default gradient background will be generated

2. **icon_x.png** (40x40 pixels)
   - Icon for the exit button (X)
   - Optional: Currently rendered as a colored rectangle

3. **icon_i.png** (40x40 pixels)
   - Icon for the info button (i)
   - Optional: Currently rendered as a colored rectangle

## Note

The application has fallback logic and will run successfully even if these images are not provided. It will generate default graphics instead.

For production, replace with actual PNG image files.
